Project Summary:

Project Title: Customer Tip Data Analysis and Linear Regression Modeling

Learning Objective:

Utilizing Python libraries for data analysis.
Proficiency in data visualization techniques.
Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing.
Building a Linear Regression model to predict tip amounts based on various input features.
Project Description:
This data analysis project focuses on the "Customer Tip Data" dataset, sourced from Kaggle, containing information on 244 orders served at a restaurant in the United States. The dataset includes attributes such as total bill, tip amount, the gender of the person paying, presence of smokers, day of the week, time of the order, and group size.

The primary learning objectives of this project are to work with Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, visualize data effectively, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and conduct data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for modeling.

The core analytical task involves building a Linear Regression model to predict tip amounts. This predictive model aims to understand the factors that influence tips provided by restaurant customers. Such insights can be valuable for restaurant management to make informed decisions about table assignments and improve overall service quality, thereby ensuring fair treatment of their staff.

By successfully completing this project, I have honed my data analysis skills, gained expertise in data visualization, and demonstrated my ability to perform EDA and data preprocessing. Moreover, I have showcased my capability to build predictive models to extract meaningful insights from real-world data, which can be applied to enhance decision-making processes in various industries, particularly the restaurant business.
